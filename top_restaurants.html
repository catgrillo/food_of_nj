                    <p>This historic restaurant is known for their unique take on pizza. At De Lorenzo’s, the tomato pie is
                        made by putting the cheese first and the pizza sauce on top. Originally, De Lorenzo’s was located in Trenton, 
                        but now it is in Robbinsville. Their new location is much more modern than the original shop, but the pizza is 
                        just as good.
