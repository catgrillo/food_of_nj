                    <p>From pork roll, to saltwater taffy, to the Italian hot dog, New Jersey is full of unique and amazing foods.
                        Whether you are walking along the boardwalk or into a deli, you know that in New Jersey you will find quality food. 
                        Located in the north east, many people know both New Jersey and New York have the best bagels and pizza. 
                        New Jersey and New York can be compared in many different aspects, but besides bagels and pizza, food is one where
                        the two states differ. New Jersey offers a rich variety of options from food trucks, to delis, to diners, and more. 
                        Fine cuisine is also not hard to find, the people of New Jersey love to indulge in all different kinds of food.

                   <h2 id="dining-types">Types of Dining</h2>

                <p>     One style of dining that is extremely popular is going to a diner. If you are ever in New Jersey, 
                    one thing is for sure, you will see diners everywhere you go. People eat at diners after a night out, 
                    with their friends, their family, or just to hangout. The menu items are universal, but the food and 
                    experience are unbeatable.

                        Another popular dining style is at a delicatessen. You can choose basically anything you want to eat here. 
                    There are soups, cold salads, hot salads, kitchen items, cold cuts, hot and colds sandwiches, and much more.
                    Delis are extremely versatile in their offerings and you know that if you go to one you will always find something that you like, or you can ask for a custom item and the cooks will make it.
